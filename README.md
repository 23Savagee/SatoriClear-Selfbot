## ã€¢ :thought_balloon:  What is SatoriClear?

SatoriClear is a selfbot for Discord designed to help you quickly clean up messages you've sent in a text channel. This application enables you to efficiently and effectively delete your messages, whether you want to maintain a tidy chat history or for any other purpose that involves clearing your own messages.

## ã€¢ :exclamation: Pre-requisites 
Before you start, make sure you have the following components installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control (optional, but recommended)

## ã€¢ :gear: How to install 
  * * *
```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/23Savagee/SatoriClear-Selfbot.git
2. npm install request discord.js-selfbot-v13 discord-rpc colors
```
## ã€¢ :rocket: Configuration
Before you can use SatoriClear, you must configure your credentials in the config.json file. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `config.json` file.
2. Replace `"YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"` with your Discord token.
3. Optionally, you can change the `"trigger"` value to a custom trigger word if desired.

Here's what your `config.json` should look like:
```json
{
    "token": "your-token-here",
    "trigger": "your-custom-trigger"
}
```
## ã€¢ :dart: Use
Once you have configured the project, you can start SatoriClear by executing the following command:
```bash
node index.js
node index-es.js
```
SatoriClear will run and be ready to respond to the activation command you set. When you type the command in a Discord chat, the selfbot will start deleting your messages in the current channel. The `index-es.js` is for people whose language is Spanish.
## ã€¢ ðŸ¤– And my Token?
Run code (Discord Console - [Ctrl + Shift + I])
```javascript
window.webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([
  [Math.random()],
  {},
  req => {
    for (const m of Object.keys(req.c)
      .map(x => req.c[x].exports)
      .filter(x => x)) {
      if (m.default && m.default.getToken !== undefined) {
        return copy(m.default.getToken());
      }
      if (m.getToken !== undefined) {
        return copy(m.getToken());
      }
    }
  },
]);
console.log('%cWorked!', 'font-size: 50px');
console.log(`%cYou now have your token in the clipboard!`, 'font-size: 16px');
```
